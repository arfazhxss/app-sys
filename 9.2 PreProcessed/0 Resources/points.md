Given the above job description, identify which of the four areas (Embedding Programming/Engineering, Web Development, Mobile Development, Quality Assurance) matches most closely with the job description, and return 4 key points for that area in TeX format from the following options:

### Embedding Programming/Engineering:
```
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Embedded Systems Design}: I have developed software for various embedded systems, focusing on integrating mechanical and electrical components to perform tasks using user inputs and sensor data. I have designed control logic for tasks such as LED blinking in response to button presses, where I utilized interrupts for real-time applications.

    \item \textbf{C/C++ Programming}: I have experience working with embedded systems primarily in C, especially in low-level memory management and hardware interfacing. I also have experience developing real-time systems using STM32 microcontrollers, where I've worked managing timers as well as GPIO configurations.

    \item \textbf{Sensor Integration and Data Acquisition}: I have experience integrating a variety of sensors, such as pressure and distance sensors, into some of my projects, which helped process real-time data for robotics applications.

    \item \textbf{Hardware-Software Co-design}: I have collaborated with electrical engineers to design and implement embedded systems. My projects often involve configuring external interrupts and implementing efficient interrupt handling for responsive applications.
\end{itemize}
```

### Web Development:
```
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Full-Stack Web Development}: I have developed full-stack web applications using React.js, Next.js, and Node.js. I am skilled in creating REST APIs for data exchange and have experience integrating front-end UIs with backend services.
    
    \item \textbf{Database Management}: I have designed and managed databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I have implemented schemas, performed complex queries, and optimized database performance for web applications.
    
    \item \textbf{Responsive and Accessible Design}: I have built user-friendly, responsive web interfaces using modern frameworks like TailwindCSS and MaterialUI in order to optimize cross-platform accessibility standards through responsive design.
    
    \item \textbf{Serverless and Cloud Integration}: I have experience developing serverless applications using AWS Lambda, Superbase and Firebase, as well as deploying applications to cloud platforms like AWS, Vercel, and Heroku for scalable performance.
\end{itemize}
```

### Mobile Development:
```
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Native iOS Development}: I have experience in developing a native iOS weather application using Swift and the UIKit framework, where I focused on integrating APIs for fetching real-time data and implemented an intuitive user interface.
    
    \item \textbf{Cross-Platform App Development}: I have built mobile applications using React Native, which enabled cross-platform compatibility for both Android and iOS devices. I also have experience integrating features such as GPS, camera, and push notifications in these applications.
    
    \item \textbf{Mobile UI/UX Design}: I have designed intuitive, user-friendly mobile interfaces for iOS devices using Figma and SwiftUI. I have experience creating a smooth navigational UI and a seamless user experience across various screen sizes.
    
    \item \textbf{Mobile Performance Optimization}: I have optimized mobile app performance by using profiling tools to reduce load times and memory usage. I have implemented offline storage with SQLite and optimized API call management.
\end{itemize}
```

### Quality Assurance (QA) and Testing:
```
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Test Automation Frameworks}: I have implemented automated testing frameworks using Selenium, JUnit, and Postman. I have experience in creating end-to-end test scripts for web applications to ensure their functionality and reliability.
    
    \item \textbf{Unit Testing and Code Coverage}: I have developed unit tests using JUnit, Mocha, and pytest to ensure code correctness. Throughout my test scripts, I have achieved high code coverage and have experienced maintaining a test-driven development (TDD) workflow.
    
    \item \textbf{API Testing and Mocking}: I have tested RESTful APIs using Postman and Newman. I have experience implementing test suites for validating API endpoints and used mocking techniques to simulate external services during testing.
    
    \item \textbf{Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment}: I have integrated automated testing into CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions. I have experience in  maintaining smooth deployment processes through running tests on every build before deployment.
\end{itemize}
```
Return the most relevant area and its corresponding 4 points in the provided TeX structure.

### Extra Items
```
	\item \textbf{Version Control and Collaboration}: I have used Git and GitHub extensively for version control and collaboration on projects, implementing best practices such as branching strategies, pull requests, and code reviews to maintain clean.
