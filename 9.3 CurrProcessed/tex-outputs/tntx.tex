\vspace{10pt}\text{Dear Hiring Manager:} \\
 I am writing to express my strong interest in the \textit{\Position} Co-op at \CompanyName. I am a software engineering student at the University of Victoria in British Columbia. I am eager to learn and grow in the field of computer and software engineering, and I believe that this role will help me gain valuable work experience related to my interests and help me acquire a practical understanding in a real-world setting. \vspace{-7pt}\\\\
Throughout my academic endeavours, I have had the chance to explore and learn about many important concepts in software engineering, such as object-oriented programming, software architecture design, agile methodologies and software testing. My academic and project experiences align well with the requirements of this position: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Full-Stack Web Development}: I have developed full-stack web applications using React.js, Next.js, and Node.js. I am skilled in creating REST APIs for data exchange and have experience integrating front-end UIs with backend services.
    
    \item \textbf{Database Management}: I have designed and managed databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I have implemented schemas, performed complex queries, and optimized database performance for web applications.
    \item \textbf{Cross-Platform App Development}: I have built mobile applications using React Native, which enabled cross-platform compatibility for both Android and iOS devices. I also have experience integrating features such as GPS, camera, and push notifications in these applications.
    \item \textbf{C/C++ Programming}: I have experience working with embedded systems primarily in C, especially in low-level memory management and hardware interfacing.     
    \item \textbf{Serverless and Cloud Integration}: I have experience developing serverless applications using AWS Lambda, Superbase and Firebase, as well as deploying applications to cloud platforms like AWS, Vercel, and Heroku for scalable performance.

\end{itemize}

I am currently available for \textbf{\Terms} work term and would be open to the possibility of participating in more than one consecutive terms. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further about this role. \\\\\\
