\vspace{10pt}\text{Dear Hiring Manager:} \\
 I am writing to express my strong interest in the \textit{\Position} Co-op at \CompanyName. I am a software engineering student at the University of Victoria in British Columbia. I am eager to learn and grow in the field of computer and software engineering, and I believe that this role will help me gain valuable work experience related to my interests and help me acquire a practical understanding in a real-world setting. \vspace{-7pt}\\\\
Throughout my academic endeavours, I have had the chance to explore and learn about many important concepts in software engineering, such as object-oriented programming, software architecture design, agile methodologies and software testing. My academic and project experiences align well with the requirements of this position: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{C++ Projects and OpenGL}: I developed a 3D Rubik's Cube simulation using C++ and OpenGL, where I implemented GLSL for enhanced visual effects. The project featured intuitive keyboard controls and dynamic zoom functionalities, showcasing my ability to write performant, interactive code.
    
    \item \textbf{Agile Experience and Tools}: After completing a comprehensive Udemy course on Agile methodologies, I worked extensively with Jira and Monday to manage sprints and collaborate with teams. My experience in Agile sprints has helped me streamline workflows and improve team communication.
    
    \item \textbf{Computational Geometry Expertise}: Through some of my C++ and Java projects, I've applied computational geometry principles, where I focused on precision and optimizing 3D transformations. I also tackled challenges with floating-point error mitigation which ensured accurate visual simulations.
    
    \item \textbf{Version Control and IDE Proficiency}: I'm proficient in Git, regularly using it for version control and collaborative development. I also have hands-on experience with Visual Studio and VS Code for debugging, writing, and managing complex codebases efficiently.
\end{itemize}
I am currently available for \textbf{\Terms} work term and would be open to the possibility of participating in more than one consecutive terms. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further about this role. \\\\\\
