\vspace{10pt}\text{Dear Hiring Manager:} \\
 I am writing to express my strong interest in the \textit{\Position} Co-op at \CompanyName. I am a software engineering student at the University of Victoria in British Columbia. I am eager to learn and grow in the field of computer and software engineering, and I believe that this role will help me gain valuable work experience related to my interests and help me acquire a practical understanding in a real-world setting. \vspace{-7pt}\\\\
Throughout my academic endeavours, I have had the chance to explore and learn about many important concepts in software engineering, such as object-oriented programming, software architecture design, agile methodologies and software testing. My academic and project experiences align well with the requirements of this position: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{System Validation and Testing}: I have experience developing end-to-end testing solutions, including unit, integration, and functional tests using frameworks like JUnit, pytest, and Mocha.
    \item \textbf{Embedded Software Development}: My technical expertise spans languages like C, C++, Python, and JavaScript. I have developed applications that involve low-level programming and hardware interfacing, such as creating a 3D simulation using C++ and OpenGL.
    \item \textbf{Design and Scripting}: I have experience with development tools and scripting languages like Bash and TCL for automation and control in testing environments.
    \item \textbf{Collaboration and Communication}: My roles in VikeLabs and the Engineering Students Society have involved leading technical teams and collaborating with multidisciplinary groups. I have presented technical information effectively and have contributed to team-based projects that require clear communication and coordination, similar to the collaborative environment of a System Validation team.
\end{itemize}
I am currently available for \textbf{\Terms} work term and would be open to the possibility of participating in more than one consecutive terms. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further about this role. \\\\
\text{Most Sincerely,}
