\vspace{10pt}\text{Dear Hiring Manager:} \\
 I am writing to express my strong interest in the \textit{\Position} Co-op at \CompanyName. I am a software engineering student at the University of Victoria in British Columbia. I am eager to learn and grow in the field of computer and software engineering, and I believe that this role will help me gain valuable work experience related to my interests and help me acquire a practical understanding in a real-world setting. \vspace{-7pt}\\\\
Throughout my academic endeavours, I have had the chance to explore and learn about many important concepts in software engineering, such as object-oriented programming, software architecture design, agile methodologies and software testing. My academic and project experiences align well with the requirements of this position: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Full-Stack Development}: I have experience developing full-stack applications, working primarily with TypeScript, React and Python. During some projects, I had the chance to design the system, develop schemas for both relational and non-relational databases such as {PostgreSQL} and {MongoDB}.

	\item \textbf{Diverse Project Portfolio}: I have completed over 13 software development projects, including an iOS weather application in Swift, a 3D Rubik's Cube simulation using C++, and several web applications using React, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

	\item \textbf{Testing and Automation}: Throughout my projects, I have utilized build automation tools like Maven and Gradle, along with web automation tools such as Selenium, Puppeteer, and WebDriverIO. I have experience working with unit testing with frameworks such as JUnit, pytest, Mocha and have experience with API testing using Postman.

	\item \textbf{Collaboration and Development}: I have been an active member of the Engineering Students Society and VikeLabs, where I've mentored and worked with fellow engineering students, participated in hackathons and coding workshops.
\end{itemize}
I am currently available for \textbf{\Terms} work term and would be open to the possibility of participating in more than two consecutive terms. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further about this role. \\\\\\
