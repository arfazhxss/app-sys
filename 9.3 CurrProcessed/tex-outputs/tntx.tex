\vspace{10pt}\text{Dear Hiring Manager:} \\
I am writing to express my strong interest in the \Position\ Co-op at \CompanyName. As a software engineering student at the University of Victoria, I am eager to apply my experience in low-level programming and full-stack development to contribute to \CompanyName's projects. This opportunity excites me because it offers the chance to work on embedded systems and real-world motion control solutions that align with my career goals. \vspace{-7pt}\\\\
Throughout my academic and project work, I have developed a solid foundation in software engineering, with specific experience that aligns well with the requirements of this position:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{C\raisebox{0.45ex}{\tiny ++} and Embedded Systems}: I have worked extensively with C\raisebox{0.45ex}{\tiny ++} and have experience programming microcontrollers and developing systems where performance and resource constraints are critical. Additionally, I've worked on hardware-related projects like a 3D Rubik's Cube simulation using C\raisebox{0.45ex}{\tiny ++}.

    \item \textbf{Mechatronics and Real-Time Systems}: I am excited to contribute to motion control systems. My coursework and experience in real-time systems have equipped me with the skills to handle time-sensitive tasks and interact with hardware components.

    \item \textbf{Testing and Documentation}: I have a strong background in unit and integration testing, using tools like JUnit, pytest, and Postman. I prioritize clear and thorough documentation to ensure maintainability and ease for future developers.

    \item \textbf{Full-Stack Development and Collaboration}: My full-stack development experience includes technologies such as TypeScript, React, and Python. I have collaborated with peers through hackathons, coding workshops, and mentorship roles with the Engineering Students Society and VikeLabs.
\end{itemize}

I am currently available for \textbf{\Terms} work term and would be open to the possibility of participating in more than two consecutive terms. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further about this role. \\\\\\
