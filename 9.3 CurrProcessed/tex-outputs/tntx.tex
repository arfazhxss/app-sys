\vspace{10pt}\text{Dear Hiring Manager:} \\
 I am writing to express my strong interest in the \textit{\Position} Co-op at \CompanyName. I am a software engineering student at the University of Victoria in British Columbia. I am eager to learn and grow in the field of computer and software engineering, and I believe that this role will help me gain valuable work experience related to my interests and help me acquire a practical understanding in a real-world setting. \vspace{-7pt}\\\\
Throughout my academic endeavours, I have had the chance to explore and learn about many important concepts in software engineering, such as object-oriented programming, software architecture design, agile methodologies and software testing. My academic and project experiences align well with the requirements of this position: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Test Automation Frameworks}: I have implemented automated testing frameworks using Selenium, JUnit, and Postman. I have experience in creating end-to-end test scripts for web applications to ensure their functionality and reliability.
    \item \textbf{Unit Testing and Code Coverage}: I have developed unit tests using JUnit, Mocha, and pytest to ensure code correctness. Throughout my test scripts, I have achieved high code coverage and have experienced maintaining a test-driven development (TDD) workflow.
    \item \textbf{Embedded Systems Design}: I have developed software for various embedded systems, focusing on integrating mechanical and electrical components to perform tasks using user inputs and sensor data. 
    \item \textbf{Sensor Integration and Data Acquisition}: I have experience integrating a variety of sensors, such as pressure and distance sensors, into some of my projects, which helped process real-time data for robotics applications.
    \item \textbf{C/C++ Programming}: I have experience working with embedded systems primarily in C, especially in low-level memory management and hardware interfacing. I also have experience developing real-time systems using STM32 microcontrollers, where I've worked managing timers as well as GPIO configurations.
\end{itemize}

I am currently available for \textbf{\Terms} work term and would be open to the possibility of participating in more than three consecutive terms. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you further about this role. \\\\
